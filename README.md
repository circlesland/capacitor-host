# Circles Capacitor Host

## How it works?

The `capacitor-host` app will require the `frame-app` as a dependency and build together the full production app. All the host specific APIs will be injected into the `window` object.

## Getting Started

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm install [frame-app]`
- Run `npm run dev`
